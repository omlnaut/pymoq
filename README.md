[tutorial](https://nbdev.fast.ai/Tutorials/tutorial.html) for nbdev.

## Install

``` sh
pip install pymoq
```

## Notes

- moved notebooks back to nbs folder
- troubles with pipelines…
  - github container doesn’t use min_python_version from settings.ini
  - manually set version in test.yaml fixes the problem, but really this
    should be auto-populated
- added vim extensions to jupyterlab
- removed egg-info dir from index. It caused the pipeline to fail
  becauce of unclean git status
- use `nbdev_prepare` to
  - build the library
  - run tests
  - clean notebooks from metadata
  - update readme from index notebook
- preview documentation
- editable install library
- install git hooks
- continue with “Check out your workflows”
- initialized nbdev repo
- initialized ssh access for github
